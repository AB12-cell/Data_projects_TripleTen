# Customer Segmentation Analysis

This project analyzes customer data from Zomato, a restaurant aggregator and food delivery service. The objective is to identify key customer segments and uncover patterns in user behavior that can inform better business decisions.

## Objective

The goal of this analysis is to understand:

- Who Zomato’s customers are
- How they behave (e.g., frequency of orders, average spend)
- How they can be segmented by demographic and behavioral traits

## Dataset

The data used in this project comes from a simulated dataset provided by TripleTen. It includes five tables:

- users
- orders
- menu
- food
- restaurant

Only the **users** and **orders** tables were used for this analysis, as they contained all relevant customer data.

## Key Research Questions

1. What is the age distribution of Zomato customers?
2. What is the gender breakdown of customers?
3. What are customers’ monthly income levels?
4. Which customer segments (by age and gender) place the most orders?
5. What is the average order value across different customer segments?
6. Are there behavioral patterns like high-spending or frequent users?

## Tools Used

- Power BI for dashboard creation and data visualization
- DAX for calculated columns and measures
- Data modeling via relationships in Power BI

## Analysis Summary

- Most customers are in the 18–35 age range.
- Income distribution shows that middle-income users dominate the customer base.
- Male customers aged 26–35 placed the highest number of orders.
- Customers aged 36–45 had the highest average order value.
- A small group of loyal users accounted for a large share of orders.

## Business Recommendations

- Focus marketing efforts on 18–35 age group.
- Offer promotions to mid-income users to increase frequency.
- Create loyalty rewards for high-spend and frequent users.
